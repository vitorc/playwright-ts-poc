## About Project

In this POC we will work in a mocked API application free for personal test [reqres](https://reqres.in/) using [playwright](https://playwright.dev/) framework to do 
this tests.
In this test we use these verbs (GET, POST, PUT and Delete) to validate Http status and some payload texts.
In the playwright.config we use baseURL to define a default URL and in the tests, we use the endpoints for the tests.
